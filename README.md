First you need to install the OpenCV library in Python which can be easily installed by using the pip command; 

> pip install opencv-python.

OpenCV library in python is blessed with many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile, etc. These XML files are stored in a folder. 
We will use the face detection model. You can download the pre-trained face detection model from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml.
